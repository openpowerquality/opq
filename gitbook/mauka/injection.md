# Message Injection

## Message Injection {#injection}

It's nice to think of Mauka as a perfect DAG of plugins, but sometimes its convenient to dynamically publish (topic, message) pairs directly into the Mauka system.

This is useful for testing, but also useful for times when we want to run a plugin of historical data. For instance, let's say a new plugin Foo is developed. In order to apply Foo's metric to data that has already been analyzed, we can inject messages into the system targetting the Foo plugin and triggering it to run over the old data.

This functionality is currently contained in [plugins/mock.py](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq/blob/master/mauka/plugins/mock.py).

The script can either be used as part of an API or as a standalone script. As long as the URL of Mauka's broker is known, we can use this inject messages into the system. This provides control over the topic, message contents, and the type of the contents (string or bytes).
