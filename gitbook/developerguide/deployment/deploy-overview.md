# Overview of deployment

This chapter documents how to deploy OPQ services---Mauka, Makai, Health, and View---to the cloud. It also documents how to configure a server to support deployment of these services. 

Currently, this documentation focuses on the process we are using to deploy OPQ services to the University of Hawaii hosting infrastructure. In future, we will provide more generic documentation.
