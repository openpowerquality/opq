# Power Quality

## What is Power Quality? {#what}

When power enters your home, it has a few expected characteristics that determine the quality of that power.
* That it is stable and non-interrupted
* That it maintains a stable voltage (*i.e.* 120 V)
* That it maintains a stable frequency (*i.e.* 60 Hz)
* That the waveform that makes up the power signal be transient free
* That the power signal has low harmonic distortion

Deviations from the above are considered power quality (PQ) issues.

## Why Care About Power Quality? {#why}

## Types of Power Quality Issues {#issues}

##### Voltage Sag
When the voltage drops below 10% to 90% of the nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.

##### Undervoltage
When the voltage drops below 90% of the nominal voltage for a duration of over a minute

##### Voltage Swell
When the voltage rises to 110% to 180% of nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.

##### Overvoltage
When the voltage rises above 110% or more of nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.

##### Voltage Flicker
When the voltage continuously transitions between multiple values between 90% and 110% of nominal voltage

##### Voltage Transients
When there is a spike, impulse, or surge

##### Frequency Sag
When the frequency drops below 99.9% of the standard

##### Frequency Swell
When the frequency rises above 100.1% of the standard

##### Frequency Fluctuation
When the frequency fluctuates around the standard value


##### Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
When the fraction of power in the sub-harmonics in respect to the main harmonic grow beyond a certain threshold
